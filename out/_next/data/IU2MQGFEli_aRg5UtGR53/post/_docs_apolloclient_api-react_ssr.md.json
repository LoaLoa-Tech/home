The result is generated using [`ReactDOMServer.renderToStaticMarkup`](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom-server.html#rendertostaticmarkup) under the hood.\n\n### Example\n\nSee [Executing queries with `getDataFromTree`](../../performance/server-side-rendering/#executing-queries-with-getdatafromtree).\n\n## `renderToStringWithData`\n\nThe `renderToStringWithData` function is similar to `getDataFromTree`, but uses [`ReactDOMServer.renderToString`](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom-server.html#rendertostring) to render its result instead of [`ReactDOMServer.renderToStaticMarkup`](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom-server.html#rendertostaticmarkup) (the React docs help explain the difference).\n\n### Params\n\n| Param | Type | description |\n| - | - | - |\n| `component` | ReactElement<any> | The React component tree you would like to render and fetch data for. |\n\n### Result\n\n`renderToStringWithData` returns a promise (`Promise<string>`) which resolves when the data is ready in your Apollo Client store. The result is generated using [`ReactDOMServer.renderToString`](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom-server.html#rendertostring) under the hood.\n"}},"__N_SSG":true}
