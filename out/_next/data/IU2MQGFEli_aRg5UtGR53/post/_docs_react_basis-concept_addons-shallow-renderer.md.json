Shallow rendering lets you render a component \"one level deep\" and assert facts about what its render method returns, without worrying about the behavior of child components, which are not instantiated or rendered. This does not require a DOM.\n\nFor example, if you have the following component:\n\n```javascript\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <span className=\"heading\">Title</span>\n      <Subcomponent foo=\"bar\" />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nThen you can assert:\n\n```javascript\nimport ShallowRenderer from 'react-test-renderer/shallow';\n\n// in your test:\nconst renderer = new ShallowRenderer();\nrenderer.render(<MyComponent />);\nconst result = renderer.getRenderOutput();\n\nexpect(result.type).toBe('div');\nexpect(result.props.children).toEqual([\n  <span className=\"heading\">Title</span>,\n  <Subcomponent foo=\"bar\" />\n]);\n```\n\nShallow testing currently has some limitations, namely not supporting refs.\n\n> Note:\n>\n> We also recommend checking out Enzyme's [Shallow Rendering API](https://airbnb.io/enzyme/docs/api/shallow.html). It provides a nicer higher-level API over the same functionality.\n\n## Reference {#reference}\n\n### `shallowRenderer.render()` {#shallowrendererrender}\n\nYou can think of the shallowRenderer as a \"place\" to render the component you're testing, and from which you can extract the component's output.\n\n`shallowRenderer.render()` is similar to [`ReactDOM.render()`](/docs/react-dom.html#render) but it doesn't require DOM and only renders a single level deep. This means you can test components isolated from how their children are implemented.\n\n### `shallowRenderer.getRenderOutput()` {#shallowrenderergetrenderoutput}\n\nAfter `shallowRenderer.render()` has been called, you can use `shallowRenderer.getRenderOutput()` to get the shallowly rendered output.\n\nYou can then begin to assert facts about the output.\n"}},"__N_SSG":true}
