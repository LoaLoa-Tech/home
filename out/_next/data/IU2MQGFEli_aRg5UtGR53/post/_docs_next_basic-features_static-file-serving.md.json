You can learn how it works here.\n---\n\n# Static File Serving\n\nNext.js can serve static files, like images, under a folder called `public` in the root directory. Files inside `public` can then be referenced by your code starting from the base URL (`/`).\n\nFor example, if you add an image to `public/me.png`, the following code will access the image:\n\n```jsx\nimport Image from 'next/image'\n\nfunction Avatar() {\n  return <Image src=\"/me.png\" alt=\"me\" width=\"64\" height=\"64\" />\n}\n\nexport default Avatar\n```\n\nThis folder is also useful for `robots.txt`, `favicon.ico`, Google Site Verification, and any other static files (including `.html`)!\n\n> **Note**: Don't name the `public` directory anything else. The name cannot be changed and is the only directory used to serve static assets.\n\n> **Note**: Be sure to not have a static file with the same name as a file in the `pages/` directory, as this will result in an error.\n>\n> Read more: <http://err.sh/next.js/conflicting-public-file-page>\n\n> **Note**: Only assets that are in the `public` directory at [build time](/docs/api-reference/cli.md#build) will be served by Next.js. Files added at runtime won't be available. We recommend using a third party service like [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) for persistent file storage.\n"}},"__N_SSG":true}
