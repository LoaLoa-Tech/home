Install it with `npm` like so:\n\n```bash\nnpm install @apollo/client graphql\n```\n\nThen wrap your application in the `ApolloProvider` component, like so:\n\n```jsx\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { AppRegistry } from 'react-native';\nimport { ApolloClient, InMemoryCache, ApolloProvider } from '@apollo/client';\n\n// Initialize Apollo Client\nconst client = new ApolloClient({\n  uri: 'localhost:4000/graphql',\n  cache: new InMemoryCache()\n});\n\nconst App = () => (\n  <ApolloProvider client={client}>\n    <MyRootComponent />\n  </ApolloProvider>\n);\n\nAppRegistry.registerComponent('MyApplication', () => App);\n```\n\nFor more information on setting up Apollo Client, see [Getting started](../get-started/).\n\n## Example application\n\n[This sample application](https://github.com/GraphQLGuide/guide-react-native) maintained by [The GraphQL Guide](https://graphql.guide/) uses Apollo Client with React Native.\n\n## Apollo Devtools\n\n[React Native Debugger](https://github.com/jhen0409/react-native-debugger) supports the [Apollo Client Devtools](../development-testing/developer-tooling/#apollo-client-devtools):\n\n1. Install React Native Debugger and open it.\n2. Enable \"Debug JS Remotely\" in your app.\n3. If you don't see the Developer Tools panel or the Apollo tab is missing from it, toggle the Developer Tools by right-clicking anywhere and selecting **Toggle Developer Tools**.\n"}},"__N_SSG":true}
