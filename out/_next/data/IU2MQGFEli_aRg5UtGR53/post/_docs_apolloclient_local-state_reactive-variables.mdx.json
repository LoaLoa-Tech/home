Because they're separate from the cache, reactive variables can store data of any type and structure, and you can interact with them anywhere in your application without using GraphQL syntax.\n\n**Most importantly, modifying a reactive variable triggers an update of every active query that depends on that variable, as well an update of the react state associated with any variable values returned from the `useReactiveVar` React hook.** A query depends on a reactive variable if any of the query's requested fields defines a [`read` function](../caching/cache-field-behavior/#the-read-function) that reads the variable's value.\n\n## Creating\n\nCreate a reactive variable with the `makeVar` method, like so:\n\n```js\nimport { makeVar } from '@apollo/client';\n\nconst cartItemsVar = makeVar([]);\n```\n\nThis code creates a reactive variable with an empty array as its initial value. \n\n> **Important:** The return value of `makeVar` is a _function_ that you call to read or modify your reactive variable's value.\n\n## Reading\n\nTo read the value of your reactive variable, call the function returned by `makeVar` with zero arguments:\n\n```js\nconst cartItemsVar = makeVar([]);\n\n// Output: []\nconsole.log(cartItemsVar());\n```\n\n## Modifying\n\nTo modify the value of your reactive variable, call the function returned by `makeVar` with one argument (the variable's new value):\n\n```js\nconst cartItemsVar = makeVar([]);\n\ncartItemsVar([100, 101, 102]);\n\n// Output: [100, 101, 102]\nconsole.log(cartItemsVar());\n\ncartItemsVar([456]);\n\n// Output: [456]\nconsole.log(cartItemsVar());\n```\n\n## Reacting\n\nAs their name suggests, reactive variables can trigger reactive changes in your application. Whenever you modify the value of a reactive variable, queries that depend on that variable refresh, and your application's UI updates accordingly.\n\nFor more information, see [Storing local state in reactive variables](./managing-state-with-field-policies/#storing-local-state-in-reactive-variables).\n\n## Example application\n\n[This example to-do list application](https://github.com/apollographql/ac3-state-management-examples/tree/master/apollo-local-state) uses reactive variables to track both the current list of to-do items and the filter that determines which items to display. See [`cache.tsx`](https://github.com/apollographql/ac3-state-management-examples/blob/master/apollo-local-state/src/cache.tsx) in particular.\n"}},"__N_SSG":true}
