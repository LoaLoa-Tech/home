[Follow the guide](/docs/guides/prisma.md)!\n\n## Database Support\n\nThe Prisma adapter currently only supports PostgreSQL databases. Future releases will enable support for all database backends which are [supported by Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/docs/more/supported-databases).\n\n## Migrations\n\n[Prisma Migrate](https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-migrate) is currently considered experimental.\nThe Prisma adapter will not be considered production ready until Prisma Migrate is also production ready.\n\n## Field types\n\nThe Prisma adapter currently has either full or partial support for almost all Keystone field types.\nWe would like to have full support for all Keystone field types, and are working on the adapter itself as well as with the Prisma team to address the remaining issues.\n\n### Unsupported field types\n\n- `Decimal`: The Decimal field type requires the use of a native type at the database level which is not currently supported by Prisma. See [Prisma:#3374](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/3374) and [Prisma:#3579](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/3579).\n\n### Partially supported field types\n\n- `File`, `CloudinaryImage`, `GoogleLocation`, `OEmbed`, `Unsplash`: These field types use the Prisma `Json` type. These field types do not currently support filtering against `null`. See [Prisma:#3579](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/3579).\n- `Password`: The `password_is_set` query does not perform a test to check is the stored value is a valid hash, as Prisma does not currently support regex filtering.\n- `Uuid`: We do not yet support using `Uuid` as a `primaryKey` field, but it can be used as a non-primary key field.\n\n## Keystone - Prisma field type mapping\n\n| Keystone Type        |         Prisma Type         |\n| :------------------- | :-------------------------: |\n| **Core fields**      |                             |\n| `CalendarDay`        |          `DateTime`         |\n| `Checkbox`           |          `Boolean`          |\n| `DateTime`           |    `DateTime` + `String`    |\n| `DateTimeUtc`        |          `DateTime`         |\n| `Decimal`            |            `N/A`            |\n| `File`               |            `Json`           |\n| `Float`              |           `Float`           |\n| `Integer`            |            `Int`            |\n| `Password`           |           `String`          |\n| `Relationship`       |         `@relation`         |\n| `Select`             | `Enum` \\| `Int` \\| `String` |\n| `Slug`               |           `String`          |\n| `Text`               |           `String`          |\n| `Url`                |           `String`          |\n| `Uuid`               |           `String`          |\n| `Virtual`            |            `N/A`            |\n| **Extra fields**     |                             |\n| `Color`              |           `String`          |\n| `Content`            |         `@relation`         |\n| `AuthedRelationship` |         `@relation`         |\n| `AutoIncrement`      |            `Int`            |\n| `CloudinaryImage`    |            `Json`           |\n| `GoogleLocation`     |            `Json`           |\n| `Markdown`           |           `String`          |\n| `MongoId`            |           `String`          |\n| `OEmbed`             |            `Json`           |\n| `Unsplash`           |            `Json`           |\n| `Wysiwyg`            |           `String`          |\n"}},"__N_SSG":true}
