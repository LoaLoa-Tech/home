You only need to do following:\n\n- Make sure to keep only the pages you need in your app, meaning that an app can't have pages from another app, if app `A` has `/blog` then app `B` shouldn't have it too.\n- Make sure to configure a [basePath](/docs/api-reference/next.config.js/basepath.md) to avoid conflicts with pages and static files.\n\n## How to merge zones\n\nYou can merge zones using [Rewrites](/docs/api-reference/next.config.js/rewrites.md) in one of the apps or any HTTP proxy.\n\nFor [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), you can use a [monorepo](https://vercel.com/blog/monorepos) to deploy both apps. Check the [Monorepos blog post](https://vercel.com/blog/monorepos) for more details on how it works and our [`with-zones` example](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-zones) for a detailed guide using multiple Next.js applications.\n"}},"__N_SSG":true}
