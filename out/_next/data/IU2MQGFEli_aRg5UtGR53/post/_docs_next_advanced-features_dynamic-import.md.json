With it you can import JavaScript modules dynamically and work with them. They also work with SSR.\n\nIn the following example, we implement fuzzy search using `fuse.js` and only load the module dynamically in the browser after the user types in the search input:\n\n```jsx\nimport { useState } from 'react'\n\nconst names = ['Tim', 'Joe', 'Bel', 'Max', 'Lee']\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  const [results, setResults] = useState()\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <input\n        type=\"text\"\n        placeholder=\"Search\"\n        onChange={async (e) => {\n          const { value } = e.currentTarget\n          // Dynamically load fuse.js\n          const Fuse = (await import('fuse.js')).default\n          const fuse = new Fuse(names)\n\n          setResults(fuse.search(value))\n        }}\n      />\n      <pre>Results: {JSON.stringify(results, null, 2)}</pre>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nYou can think of dynamic imports as another way to split your code into manageable chunks.\n\nReact components can also be imported using dynamic imports, but in this case we use it in conjunction with `next/dynamic` to make sure it works just like any other React Component. Check out the sections below for more details on how it works.\n\n## Basic usage\n\nIn the following example, the module `../components/hello` will be dynamically loaded by the page:\n\n```jsx\nimport dynamic from 'next/dynamic'\n\nconst DynamicComponent = dynamic(() => import('../components/hello'))\n\nfunction Home() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <Header />\n      <DynamicComponent />\n      <p>HOME PAGE is here!</p>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default Home\n```\n\n`DynamicComponent` will be the default component returned by `../components/hello`. It works like a regular React Component, and you can pass props to it as you normally would.\n\n> **Note**: `import()` needs to be explicitly written without template strings. Furthermore the `import()` has to be inside the `dynamic()` call for Next.js to be able to match webpack bundles / module ids to the specific `dynamic()` call and preload them before rendering. `dynamic()` can't be used inside of React rendering as it needs to be marked in the top level of the module for preloading to work, similar to `React.lazy`.\n\n## With named exports\n\nIf the dynamic component is not the default export, you can use a named export too. Consider the module `../components/hello.js` which has a named export `Hello`:\n\n```jsx\nexport function Hello() {\n  return <p>Hello!</p>\n}\n```\n\nTo dynamically import the `Hello` component, you can return it from the [Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) returned by [`import()`](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-dynamic-import#example), like so:\n\n```jsx\nimport dynamic from 'next/dynamic'\n\nconst DynamicComponent = dynamic(() =>\n  import('../components/hello').then((mod) => mod.Hello)\n)\n\nfunction Home() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <Header />\n      <DynamicComponent />\n      <p>HOME PAGE is here!</p>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default Home\n```\n\n## With custom loading component\n\nAn optional `loading` component can be added to render a loading state while the dynamic component is being loaded. For example:\n\n```jsx\nimport dynamic from 'next/dynamic'\n\nconst DynamicComponentWithCustomLoading = dynamic(\n  () => import('../components/hello'),\n  { loading: () => <p>...</p> }\n)\n\nfunction Home() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <Header />\n      <DynamicComponentWithCustomLoading />\n      <p>HOME PAGE is here!</p>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default Home\n```\n\n## With no SSR\n\nYou may not always want to include a module on server-side. For example, when the module includes a library that only works in the browser.\n\nTake a look at the following example:\n\n```jsx\nimport dynamic from 'next/dynamic'\n\nconst DynamicComponentWithNoSSR = dynamic(\n  () => import('../components/hello3'),\n  { ssr: false }\n)\n\nfunction Home() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <Header />\n      <DynamicComponentWithNoSSR />\n      <p>HOME PAGE is here!</p>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default Home\n```\n"}},"__N_SSG":true}
