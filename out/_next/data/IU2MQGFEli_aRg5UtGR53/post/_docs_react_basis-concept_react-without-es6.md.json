This means that they don't automatically bind `this` to the instance. You'll have to explicitly use `.bind(this)` in the constructor:\n\n```javascript\nclass SayHello extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = {message: 'Hello!'};\n    // This line is important!\n    this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this);\n  }\n\n  handleClick() {\n    alert(this.state.message);\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    // Because `this.handleClick` is bound, we can use it as an event handler.\n    return (\n      <button onClick={this.handleClick}>\n        Say hello\n      </button>\n    );\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWith `createReactClass()`, this is not necessary because it binds all methods:\n\n```javascript\nvar SayHello = createReactClass({\n  getInitialState: function() {\n    return {message: 'Hello!'};\n  },\n\n  handleClick: function() {\n    alert(this.state.message);\n  },\n\n  render: function() {\n    return (\n      <button onClick={this.handleClick}>\n        Say hello\n      </button>\n    );\n  }\n});\n```\n\nThis means writing ES6 classes comes with a little more boilerplate code for event handlers, but the upside is slightly better performance in large applications.\n\nIf the boilerplate code is too unattractive to you, you may enable the **experimental** [Class Properties](https://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/transform-class-properties/) syntax proposal with Babel:\n\n\n```javascript\nclass SayHello extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = {message: 'Hello!'};\n  }\n  // WARNING: this syntax is experimental!\n  // Using an arrow here binds the method:\n  handleClick = () => {\n    alert(this.state.message);\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <button onClick={this.handleClick}>\n        Say hello\n      </button>\n    );\n  }\n}\n```\n\nPlease note that the syntax above is **experimental** and the syntax may change, or the proposal might not make it into the language.\n\nIf you'd rather play it safe, you have a few options:\n\n* Bind methods in the constructor.\n* Use arrow functions, e.g. `onClick={(e) => this.handleClick(e)}`.\n* Keep using `createReactClass`.\n\n## Mixins {#mixins}\n\n>**Note:**\n>\n>ES6 launched without any mixin support. Therefore, there is no support for mixins when you use React with ES6 classes.\n>\n>**We also found numerous issues in codebases using mixins, [and don't recommend using them in the new code](/blog/2016/07/13/mixins-considered-harmful.html).**\n>\n>This section exists only for the reference.\n\nSometimes very different components may share some common functionality. These are sometimes called [cross-cutting concerns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-cutting_concern). `createReactClass` lets you use a legacy `mixins` system for that.\n\nOne common use case is a component wanting to update itself on a time interval. It's easy to use `setInterval()`, but it's important to cancel your interval when you don't need it anymore to save memory. React provides [lifecycle methods](/docs/react-component.html#the-component-lifecycle) that let you know when a component is about to be created or destroyed. Let's create a simple mixin that uses these methods to provide an easy `setInterval()` function that will automatically get cleaned up when your component is destroyed.\n\n```javascript\nvar SetIntervalMixin = {\n  componentWillMount: function() {\n    this.intervals = [];\n  },\n  setInterval: function() {\n    this.intervals.push(setInterval.apply(null, arguments));\n  },\n  componentWillUnmount: function() {\n    this.intervals.forEach(clearInterval);\n  }\n};\n\nvar createReactClass = require('create-react-class');\n\nvar TickTock = createReactClass({\n  mixins: [SetIntervalMixin], // Use the mixin\n  getInitialState: function() {\n    return {seconds: 0};\n  },\n  componentDidMount: function() {\n    this.setInterval(this.tick, 1000); // Call a method on the mixin\n  },\n  tick: function() {\n    this.setState({seconds: this.state.seconds + 1});\n  },\n  render: function() {\n    return (\n      <p>\n        React has been running for {this.state.seconds} seconds.\n      </p>\n    );\n  }\n});\n\nReactDOM.render(\n  <TickTock />,\n  document.getElementById('example')\n);\n```\n\nIf a component is using multiple mixins and several mixins define the same lifecycle method (i.e. several mixins want to do some cleanup when the component is destroyed), all of the lifecycle methods are guaranteed to be called. Methods defined on mixins run in the order mixins were listed, followed by a method call on the component.\n"}},"__N_SSG":true}
