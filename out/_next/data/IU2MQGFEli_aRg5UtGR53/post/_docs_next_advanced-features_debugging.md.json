You can find more details in the [Node.js documentation](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/debugging-getting-started/).\n\n## Step 1: Start Next.js in debug mode\n\nNext.js being a Node.js application, all we have to do is to pass down the [`--inspect`](https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html#cli_node_options_options) flag to the underlying Node.js process for it to start in debug mode.\n\nFirst, start Next.js with the inspect flag:\n\n```bash\nNODE_OPTIONS='--inspect' next dev\n```\n\nIf you're using `npm run dev` or `yarn dev` (See: [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started.md)) then you should update the `dev` script on your `package.json`:\n\n```json\n\"dev\": \"NODE_OPTIONS='--inspect' next dev\"\n```\n\nThe result of launching Next.js with the inspect flag looks like this:\n\n```bash\nDebugger listening on ws://127.0.0.1:9229/0cf90313-350d-4466-a748-cd60f4e47c95\nFor help, see: https://nodejs.org/en/docs/inspector\nready - started server on http://localhost:3000\n```\n\n> Be aware that using `NODE_OPTIONS='--inspect' npm run dev` or `NODE_OPTIONS='--inspect' yarn dev` won't work. This would try to start multiple debuggers on the same port: one for the npm/yarn process and one for Next.js. You would then get an error like `Starting inspector on 127.0.0.1:9229 failed: address already in use` in your console.\n\n## Step 2: Connect to the debugger\n\n### Using Chrome DevTools\n\nOnce you open a new tab in Google Chrome and go to `chrome://inspect`, you should see your Next.js application inside the \"Remote Target\" section. Now click \"inspect\" to open a screen that will be your debugging environment from now on.\n\n### Using the Debugger in Visual Studio Code\n\nWe will be using the [attach mode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/nodejs/nodejs-debugging#_setting-up-an-attach-configuration) of VS Code to attach the VS Code inspector to our running debugger started in step 1.\n\nCreate a file named `.vscode/launch.json` at the root of your project with this content:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"version\": \"0.2.0\",\n  \"configurations\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"node\",\n      \"request\": \"attach\",\n      \"name\": \"Launch Program\",\n      \"skipFiles\": [\"<node_internals>/**\"],\n      \"port\": 9229\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nNow hit <kdb>F5</kbd> or select **Debug: Start Debugging** from the Command Palette and you can start your debugging session.\n\n## Step 3: Put breakpoints and see what happens\n\nNow you can use the [`debugger`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/debugger) statement to pause your backend or frontend code anytime you want to observe and debug your code more precisely.\n\nIf you trigger the underlying code by refreshing the current page, clicking on a page link or fetching an API route, your code will be paused and the debugger window will pop up.\n\nTo learn more on how to use a JavaScript debugger, take a look at the following documentation:\n\n- [VS Code Node.js debugging: Breakpoints](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/nodejs/nodejs-debugging#_breakpoints)\n- [Get Started with Debugging JavaScript in Chrome DevTools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/javascript)\n"}},"__N_SSG":true}
