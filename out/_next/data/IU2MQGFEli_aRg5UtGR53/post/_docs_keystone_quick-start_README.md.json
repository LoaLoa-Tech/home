You can change it later if you like.\n2. **Select a starter project.** These are some preconfigured projects you can use as the base of your own application. Select the `Todo` application if you wish to follow the rest of the Keystone tutorials.\n3. **Select a database type.** Choose between `MongoDB` and `PostgreSQL`.\n4. **Where is your database located?** Provide the `connection string` for your database.\n5. **Test your database connection.** Test that Keystone can connect to your database.\n\nOnce you have answered these questions, Keystone will be installed in a project directory.\nThis will take a few minutes, as there are a number of dependencies which need to be downloaded and installed.\n\nOnce your project has been set up you should move into its directory so that you can start using it\n\n```shell allowCopy=false showLanguage=false\ncd my-app\n```\n\nIf you are using `PostgreSQL` then you will need to create the tables in your database for Keystone to use.\n\n```\nyarn create-tables\n# or\nnpm run create-tables\n```\n\nYou can now start your development server with the following command:\n\n```\nyarn dev\n# or\nnpm run dev\n```\n\n### Troubleshooting\n\nIf you run into database related errors at this stage, follow the [Database Setup and Adapters](/docs/quick-start/adapters.md) instructions.\n\n## Summary\n\nYou are now running your very own Keystone application! Here's what you get out of the box:\n\n### Application\n\nYour simple todo application is up and running:\n\n- <http://localhost:3000>\n\n### Admin UI\n\nYour application also has an Admin UI, which lets you directly manipulate the data in your database:\n\n- <http://localhost:3000/admin>\n\n### GraphQL API\n\nBoth your application and the Admin UI are powered by a GraphQL API.\nKeystone provides a web interface for this API at this URL:\n\n- <http://localhost:3000/admin/graphiql>\n\n## Next steps\n\nThis todo app is a good introduction to Keystone, but chances are you'll want to build something a bit more complex and secure than that!\n\n<!-- FIXME:TL Next step should be tutorials, not guides. -->\n\nThe [guides section](/docs/guides/apps.md) is a great next step.\nIt will walk you through concepts like [creating lists](/docs/tutorials/add-lists.md),\nsetting up [content relationships](/docs/tutorials/relationships.md),\nmanaging [access control](/docs/guides/access-control.md) and much more.\n"}},"__N_SSG":true}
