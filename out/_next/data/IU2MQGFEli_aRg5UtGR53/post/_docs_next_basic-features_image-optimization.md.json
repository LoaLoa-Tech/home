This avoids shipping large images to devices with a smaller viewport. It also allows Next.js to automatically adopt future image formats and serve them to browsers that support those formats.\n\nAutomatic Image Optimization works with any image source. Even if the image is hosted by an external data source, like a CMS, it can still be optimized.\n\nInstead of optimizing images at build time, Next.js optimizes images on-demand, as users request them. Unlike static site generators and static-only solutions, your build times aren't increased, whether shipping 10 images or 10 million images.\n\nImages are lazy loaded by default. That means your page speed isn't penalized for images outside the viewport. Images load as they are scrolled into viewport.\n\nImages are always rendered in such a way as to avoid [Cumulative Layout Shift](https://web.dev/cls/), a [Core Web Vital](https://web.dev/vitals/) that Google is going to [use in search ranking](https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2020/05/evaluating-page-experience.html).\n\n## Image Component\n\nTo add an image to your application, import the [`next/image`](/docs/api-reference/next/image.md) component:\n\n```jsx\nimport Image from 'next/image'\n\nfunction Home() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <h1>My Homepage</h1>\n      <Image\n        src=\"/me.png\"\n        alt=\"Picture of the author\"\n        width={500}\n        height={500}\n      />\n      <p>Welcome to my homepage!</p>\n    </>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default Home\n```\n\n[View all properties](/docs/api-reference/next/image.md) available to the `next/image` component.\n\n## Configuration\n\nIn addition to [using properties](/docs/api-reference/next/image.md) available to the `next/image` component, you can optionally configure Image Optimization for more advanced use cases via `next.config.js`.\n\n### Domains\n\nTo enable Image Optimization for images hosted on an external website, use an absolute url for the Image `src` and specify which\n`domains` are allowed to be optimized. This is needed to ensure that external urls can't be abused.\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = {\n  images: {\n    domains: ['example.com'],\n  },\n}\n```\n\n### Loader\n\nIf you want to use a cloud provider to optimize images instead of using the Next.js' built-in Image Optimization, you can configure the loader and path prefix. This allows you to use relative urls for the Image `src` and automatically generate the correct absolute url for your provider.\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = {\n  images: {\n    loader: 'imgix',\n    path: 'https://example.com/myaccount/',\n  },\n}\n```\n\nThe following Image Optimization cloud providers are supported:\n\n- [Vercel](https://vercel.com): Works automatically when you deploy on Vercel, no configuration necessary. [Learn more](https://vercel.com/docs/next.js/image-optimization)\n- [Imgix](https://www.imgix.com): `loader: 'imgix'`\n- [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com): `loader: 'cloudinary'`\n- [Akamai](https://www.akamai.com): `loader: 'akamai'`\n- Default: Works automatically with `next dev`, `next start`, or a custom server\n\n## Caching\n\nThe following describes the caching algorithm for the default [loader](#loader). For all other loaders, please refer to your cloud provider's documentation.\n\nImages are optimized dynamically upon request and stored in the `<distDir>/cache/images` directory. The optimized image file will be served for subsequent requests until the expiration is reached. When a request is made that matches a cached but expired file, the cached file is deleted before generating a new optimized image and caching the new file.\n\nThe expiration (or rather Max Age) is defined by the upstream server's `Cache-Control` header.\n\nIf `s-maxage` is found in `Cache-Control`, it is used. If no `s-maxage` is found, then `max-age` is used. If no `max-age` is found, then 60 seconds is used.\n\nYou can configure [`deviceSizes`](#device-sizes) and [`imageSizes`](#device-sizes) to reduce the total number of possible generated images.\n\n## Advanced\n\nThe following configuration is for advanced use cases and is usually not necessary. If you choose to configure the properties below, you will override any changes to the Next.js defaults in future updates.\n\n### Device Sizes\n\nIn some cases, where you know the expected device widths from the users of your website, you can specify a list of device width breakpoints using the `deviceSizes` property. These widths are used when the [`next/image`](/docs/api-reference/next/image.md) component uses `layout=\"responsive\"` or `layout=\"fill\"` so that the correct image is served for the device visiting your website.\n\nIf no configuration is provided, the default below is used.\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = {\n  images: {\n    deviceSizes: [640, 750, 828, 1080, 1200, 1920, 2048, 3840],\n  },\n}\n```\n\n### Image Sizes\n\nYou can specify a list of image widths using the `imageSizes` property. These widths should be different (usually smaller) than the widths defined in `deviceSizes` because the arrays will be concatenated. These widths are used when the [`next/image`](/docs/api-reference/next/image.md) component uses `layout=\"fixed\"` or `layout=\"intrinsic\"`.\n\nIf no configuration is provided, the default below is used.\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = {\n  images: {\n    imageSizes: [16, 32, 48, 64, 96, 128, 256, 384],\n  },\n}\n```\n\n## Related\n\nFor more information on what to do next, we recommend the following sections:\n\n<div class=\"card\">\n  <a href=\"/docs/api-reference/next/image.md\">\n    <b>next/image</b>\n    <small>See all available properties for the Image component</small>\n  </a>\n</div>\n"}},"__N_SSG":true}
