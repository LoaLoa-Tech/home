Rather than position itself as a competitor to any of the above, Keystone empowers people by not limiting these choices.\n\nThere may be complementary services, plugins or packages that tie in with the above. Although we will avoid adding these features to 'core' we want to provide a supportive environment for these to be developed within the Keystone community.\n\nWe also want to ensure Keystone works well with static sites and serverless architecture. This goal will help keep Keystone light-weight, nimble, customisable and not tied to a specific architecture, in-line with our core goals.\n\n## Our current focus\n\nA lot of work has been done on Keystone's core architecture. In this area Keystone 5 is significantly more mature than Keystone 4 was. We'd like to add database transactions, slightly refactor some of the internal workings of relationship fields and make the experience of database migrations easier. Aside from this we imagine the core architecture will remain largely the same.\n\nIn the short term we want to focus on a better onboarding experience and making it easier to build typical applications with Keystone. This involves better error messages, documentation and examples, extensibility of the AdminUI as well as new field types and adapters.\n\nAll PRs in these areas will be welcome. The list of features and bugs below represents identified tasks that align with Keystone's core goals and current focus. Although the core goals of this project will remain the same, some tasks may evolve, new tasks may be added and priorities might change.
