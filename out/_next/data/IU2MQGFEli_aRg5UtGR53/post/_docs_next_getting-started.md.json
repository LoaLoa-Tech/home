To create a project, run:\n\n```bash\nnpx create-next-app\n# or\nyarn create next-app\n```\n\nAfter the installation is complete, follow the instructions to start the development server. Try editing `pages/index.js` and see the result on your browser.\n\nFor more information on how to use `create-next-app`, you can review the [`create-next-app` documentation](/docs/api-reference/create-next-app.md)\n\n## Manual Setup\n\nInstall `next`, `react` and `react-dom` in your project:\n\n```bash\nnpm install next react react-dom\n# or\nyarn add next react react-dom\n```\n\nOpen `package.json` and add the following `scripts`:\n\n```json\n\"scripts\": {\n  \"dev\": \"next dev\",\n  \"build\": \"next build\",\n  \"start\": \"next start\"\n}\n```\n\nThese scripts refer to the different stages of developing an application:\n\n- `dev` - Runs [`next dev`](/docs/api-reference/cli.md#development) which starts Next.js in development mode\n- `build` - Runs [`next build`](/docs/api-reference/cli.md#build) which builds the application for production usage\n- `start` - Runs [`next start`](/docs/api-reference/cli.md#production) which starts a Next.js production server\n\nNext.js is built around the concept of [pages](/docs/basic-features/pages.md). A page is a [React Component](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html) exported from a `.js`, `.jsx`, `.ts`, or `.tsx` file in the `pages` directory.\n\nPages are associated with a route based on their file name. For example `pages/about.js` is mapped to `/about`. You can even add dynamic route parameters with the filename.\n\nCreate a `pages` directory inside your project.\n\nPopulate `./pages/index.js` with the following contents:\n\n```jsx\nfunction HomePage() {\n  return <div>Welcome to Next.js!</div>\n}\n\nexport default HomePage\n```\n\nTo start developing your application run `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`. This starts the development server on `http://localhost:3000`.\n\nVisit `http://localhost:3000` to view your application.\n\nSo far, we get:\n\n- Automatic compilation and bundling (with webpack and babel)\n- [React Fast Refresh](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-9-4#fast-refresh)\n- [Static generation and server-side rendering](/docs/basic-features/data-fetching.md) of [`./pages/`](/docs/basic-features/pages.md)\n- [Static file serving](/docs/basic-features/static-file-serving.md). `./public/` is mapped to `/`\n\nIn addition, any Next.js application is ready for production from the start, read more in our [Deployment documentation](/docs/deployment.md).\n\n## Related\n\nFor more information on what to do next, we recommend the following sections:\n\n<div class=\"card\">\n  <a href=\"/docs/basic-features/pages.md\">\n    <b>Pages:</b>\n    <small>Learn more about what pages are in Next.js.</small>\n  </a>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"card\">\n  <a href=\"/docs/basic-features/built-in-css-support.md\">\n    <b>CSS Support:</b>\n    <small>Use the built-in CSS support to add custom styles to your app.</small>\n  </a>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"card\">\n  <a href=\"/docs/api-reference/cli.md\">\n    <b>CLI:</b>\n    <small>Learn more about the Next.js CLI.</small>\n  </a>\n</div>\n"}},"__N_SSG":true}
