This simple CLI tool enables you to quickly start building a new Next.js application, with everything set up for you. You can create a new app using the default Next.js template, or by using one of the [official Next.js examples](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples). To get started, use the following command:\n\n```bash\nnpx create-next-app\n# or\nyarn create next-app\n```\n\n### Options\n\n`create-next-app` comes with the following options:\n\n- **-e, --example [name]|[github-url]** - An example to bootstrap the app with. You can use an example name from the [Next.js repo](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/master/examples) or a GitHub URL. The URL can use any branch and/or subdirectory.\n- **--example-path [path-to-example]** - In a rare case, your GitHub URL might contain a branch name with a slash (e.g. bug/fix-1) and the path to the example (e.g. foo/bar). In this case, you must specify the path to the example separately: `--example-path foo/bar`\n- **--use-npm** - Explicitly tell the CLI to bootstrap the app using npm. Yarn will be used by default if it's installed\n\n### Why use Create Next App?\n\n`create-next-app` allows you to create a new Next.js app within seconds. It is officially maintained by the creators of Next.js, and includes a number of benefits:\n\n- **Interactive Experience**: Running `npx create-next-app` (with no arguments) launches an interactive experience that guides you through setting up a project.\n- **Zero Dependencies**: Initializing a project is as quick as one second. Create Next App has zero dependencies.\n- **Offline Support**: Create Next App will automatically detect if you're offline and bootstrap your project using your local package cache.\n- **Support for Examples**: Create Next App can bootstrap your application using an example from the Next.js examples collection (e.g. `npx create-next-app --example api-routes`).\n- **Tested**: The package is part of the Next.js monorepo and tested using the same integration test suite as Next.js itself, ensuring it works as expected with every release.\n\n## Related\n\nFor more information on what to do next, we recommend the following sections:\n\n<div class=\"card\">\n  <a href=\"/docs/basic-features/pages.md\">\n    <b>Pages:</b>\n    <small>Learn more about what pages are in Next.js.</small>\n  </a>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"card\">\n  <a href=\"/docs/basic-features/built-in-css-support.md\">\n    <b>CSS Support:</b>\n    <small>Use the built-in CSS support to add custom styles to your app.</small>\n  </a>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"card\">\n  <a href=\"/docs/api-reference/cli.md\">\n    <b>CLI:</b>\n    <small>Learn more about the Next.js CLI.</small>\n  </a>\n</div>\n"}},"__N_SSG":true}
