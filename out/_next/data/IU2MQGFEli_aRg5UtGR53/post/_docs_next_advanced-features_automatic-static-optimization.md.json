Learn how it works here.\n---\n\n# Automatic Static Optimization\n\nNext.js automatically determines that a page is static (can be prerendered) if it has no blocking data requirements. This determination is made by the absence of `getServerSideProps` and `getInitialProps` in the page.\n\nThis feature allows Next.js to emit hybrid applications that contain **both server-rendered and statically generated pages**.\n\n> Statically generated pages are still reactive: Next.js will hydrate your application client-side to give it full interactivity.\n\nOne of the main benefits of this feature is that optimized pages require no server-side computation, and can be instantly streamed to the end-user from multiple CDN locations. The result is an _ultra fast_ loading experience for your users.\n\n## How it works\n\nIf `getServerSideProps` or `getInitialProps` is present in a page, Next.js will switch to render the page on-demand, per-request (meaning [Server-Side Rendering](/docs/basic-features/pages.md#server-side-rendering)).\n\nIf the above is not the case, Next.js will **statically optimize** your page automatically by prerendering the page to static HTML.\n\nDuring prerendering, the router's `query` object will be empty since we do not have `query` information to provide during this phase. After hydration, Next.js will trigger an update to your application to provide the route parameters in the `query` object.\n\n> **Note:** Parameters added with [dynamic routes](/docs/routing/dynamic-routes.md) to a page that's using [`getStaticProps`](/docs/basic-features/data-fetching.md#getstaticprops-static-generation) will always be available inside the `query` object.\n\n`next build` will emit `.html` files for statically optimized pages. For example, the result for the page `pages/about.js` would be:\n\n```bash\n.next/server/static/${BUILD_ID}/about.html\n```\n\nAnd if you add `getServerSideProps` to the page, it will then be JavaScript, like so:\n\n```bash\n.next/server/static/${BUILD_ID}/about.js\n```\n\n## Caveats\n\n- If you have a [custom `App`](/docs/advanced-features/custom-app.md) with `getInitialProps` then this optimization will be turned off in pages without [Static Generation](/docs/basic-features/data-fetching.md#getstaticprops-static-generation).\n- If you have a [custom `Document`](/docs/advanced-features/custom-document.md) with `getInitialProps` be sure you check if `ctx.req` is defined before assuming the page is server-side rendered. `ctx.req` will be `undefined` for pages that are prerendered.\n"}},"__N_SSG":true}
