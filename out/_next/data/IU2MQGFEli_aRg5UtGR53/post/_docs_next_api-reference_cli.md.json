The output displays information about each route.\n\n- **Size** – The number of assets downloaded when navigating to the page client-side. The size for each route only includes its dependencies.\n- **First Load JS** – The number of assets downloaded when visiting the page from the server. The amount of JS shared by all is shown as a separate metric.\n\nThe first load is colored green, yellow, or red. Aim for green for performant applications.\n\nYou can enable production profiling for React with the `--profile` flag in `next build`. This requires [Next.js 9.5](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-9-5):\n\n```bash\nnext build --profile\n```\n\nAfter that, you can use the profiler in the same way as you would in development.\n\nYou can enable more verbose build output with the `--debug` flag in `next build`. This requires Next.js 9.5.3:\n\n```bash\nnext build --debug\n```\n\nWith this flag enabled additional build output like rewrites, redirects, and headers will be shown.\n\n## Development\n\n`next dev` starts the application in development mode with hot-code reloading, error reporting, and more:\n\nThe application will start at `http://localhost:3000` by default. The default port can be changed with `-p`, like so:\n\n```bash\nnpx next dev -p 4000\n```\n\n## Production\n\n`next start` starts the application in production mode. The application should be compiled with [`next build`](#build) first.\n\nThe application will start at `http://localhost:3000` by default. The default port can be changed with `-p`, like so:\n\n```bash\nnpx next start -p 4000\n```\n\n## Telemetry\n\nNext.js collects **completely anonymous** telemetry data about general usage.\nParticipation in this anonymous program is optional, and you may opt-out if you'd not like to share any information.\n\nTo learn more about Telemetry, [please read this document](https://nextjs.org/telemetry/).\n"}},"__N_SSG":true}
