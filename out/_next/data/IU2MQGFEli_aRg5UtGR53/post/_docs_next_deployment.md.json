[Vercel](https://vercel.com) is an all-in-one platform with Global CDN supporting static & Jamstack deployment and Serverless Functions.\n\n### Getting started\n\nIf you haven’t already done so, push your Next.js app to a Git provider of your choice: [GitHub](http://github.com/), [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/), or [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/). Your repository can be private or public.\n\nThen, follow these steps:\n\n1. [Sign up to Vercel](https://vercel.com/signup) (no credit card is required).\n2. After signing up, you’ll arrive on the [“Import Project”](https://vercel.com/import) page. Under “From Git Repository”, choose the Git provider you use and set up an integration. (Instructions: [GitHub](https://vercel.com/docs/v2/git-integrations/vercel-for-github) / [GitLab](https://vercel.com/docs/v2/git-integrations/vercel-for-gitlab) / [BitBucket](https://vercel.com/docs/v2/git-integrations/vercel-for-bitbucket)).\n3. Once that’s set up, click “Import Project From …” and import your Next.js app. It auto-detects that your app is using Next.js and sets up the build configuration for you. No need to change anything — everything should work just fine!\n4. After importing, it’ll deploy your Next.js app and provide you with a deployment URL. Click “Visit” to see your app in production.\n\nCongratulations! You’ve just deployed your Next.js app! If you have questions, take a look at the [Vercel documentation](https://vercel.com/docs).\n\n> If you’re using a [custom server](/docs/advanced-features/custom-server.md), we strongly recommend migrating away from it (for example, by using [dynamic routing](/docs/routing/dynamic-routes.md)). If you cannot migrate, consider [other hosting options](#other-hosting-options).\n\n### DPS: Develop, Preview, Ship\n\nLet’s talk about the workflow we recommend using. [Vercel](https://vercel.com) supports what we call the **DPS** workflow: **D**evelop, **P**review, and **S**hip:\n\n- **Develop:** Write code in Next.js. Keep the development server running and take advantage of [React Fast Refresh](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-9-4#fast-refresh).\n- **Preview:** Every time you push changes to a branch on GitHub / GitLab / BitBucket, Vercel automatically creates a new deployment with a unique URL. You can view them on GitHub when you open a pull request, or under “Preview Deployments” on your project page on Vercel. [Learn more about it here](https://vercel.com/features/deployment-previews).\n- **Ship:** When you’re ready to ship, merge the pull request to your default branch (e.g. `master`). Vercel will automatically create a production deployment.\n\nBy using the DPS workflow, in addition to doing _code reviews_, you can do _deployment previews_. Each deployment creates a unique URL that can be shared or used for integration tests.\n\n### Optimized for Next.js\n\n[Vercel](https://vercel.com) is made by the creators of Next.js and has first-class support for Next.js.\n\nFor example, the [hybrid pages](/docs/basic-features/pages.md) approach is fully supported out of the box.\n\n- Every page can either use [Static Generation](/docs/basic-features/pages.md#static-generation) or [Server-Side Rendering](/docs/basic-features/pages.md#server-side-rendering).\n- Pages that use [Static Generation](/docs/basic-features/pages.md#static-generation) and assets (JS, CSS, images, fonts, etc) will automatically be served from [Vercel's Edge Network](https://vercel.com/docs/v2/edge-network/overview), which is blazingly fast.\n- Pages that use [Server-Side Rendering](/docs/basic-features/pages.md#server-side-rendering) and [API routes](/docs/api-routes/introduction.md) will automatically become isolated Serverless Functions. This allows page rendering and API requests to scale infinitely.\n\n### Custom Domains, Environment Variables, Automatic HTTPS, and more\n\n- **Custom Domains:** Once deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com), you can assign a custom domain to your Next.js app. Take a look at [our documentation here](https://vercel.com/docs/v2/custom-domains).\n- **Environment Variables:** You can also set environment variables on Vercel. Take a look at [our documentation here](https://vercel.com/docs/v2/build-step#using-environment-variables-and-secrets). You can then [use those environment variables](/docs/api-reference/next.config.js/environment-variables.md) in your Next.js app.\n- **Automatic HTTPS:** HTTPS is enabled by default (including custom domains) and doesn't require extra configuration. We auto-renew SSL certificates.\n- **More:** [Read our documentation](https://vercel.com/docs) to learn more about the Vercel platform.\n\n## Other hosting options\n\n### Node.js Server\n\nNext.js can be deployed to any hosting provider that supports Node.js. This is the approach you should take if you’re using a [custom server](/docs/advanced-features/custom-server.md).\n\nMake sure your `package.json` has the `\"build\"` and `\"start\"` scripts:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"dev\": \"next\",\n    \"build\": \"next build\",\n    \"start\": \"next start\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n`next build` builds the production application in the `.next` folder. After building, `next start` starts a Node.js server that supports [hybrid pages](/docs/basic-features/pages.md), serving both statically generated and server-side rendered pages.\n\n### Static HTML Export\n\nIf you’d like to do a static HTML export of your Next.js app, follow the directions on [our documentation](/docs/advanced-features/static-html-export.md).\n"}},"__N_SSG":true}
