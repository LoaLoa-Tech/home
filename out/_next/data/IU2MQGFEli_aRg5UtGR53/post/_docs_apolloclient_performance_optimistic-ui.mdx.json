Once the response is received from the server, the optimistic result is thrown away and replaced with the actual result.\n\nOptimistic UI provides an easy way to make your UI respond much faster, while ensuring that the data becomes consistent with the actual response when it arrives.\n\n## Basic optimistic UI\n\nLet's say we have an \"edit comment\" mutation, and we want the UI to update immediately when the user submits the mutation, instead of waiting for the server response. This is what the `optimisticResponse` parameter to the `mutate` function provides.\n\nThe main way to get GraphQL data into your UI components with Apollo is to use a query, so if we want our optimistic response to update the UI, we have to make sure to return an optimistic response that will update the correct query result. Learn more about how to do this with the [`dataIdFromObject`](../caching/cache-configuration/#data-normalization) option.\n\nHere's what this looks like in the code:\n\n```jsx\nconst UPDATE_COMMENT = gql`\n  mutation UpdateComment($commentId: ID!, $commentContent: String!) {\n    updateComment(commentId: $commentId, content: $commentContent) {\n      id\n      __typename\n      content\n    }\n  }\n`;\n\nfunction CommentPageWithData() {\n  const [mutate] = useMutation(UPDATE_COMMENT);\n  return (\n    <Comment\n      updateComment={({ commentId, commentContent }) =>\n        mutate({\n          variables: { commentId, commentContent },\n          optimisticResponse: {\n            __typename: \"Mutation\",\n            updateComment: {\n              id: commentId,\n              __typename: \"Comment\",\n              content: commentContent\n            }\n          }\n        })\n      }\n    />\n  );\n}\n```\n\nWe select `id` and `__typename` because that's what our `dataIdFromObject` uses to determine a globally unique object ID. We need to make sure to provide the right values for those fields, so that Apollo knows what object we are referring to.\n\n## Adding to a list\n\nIn the example above, we showed how to seamlessly edit an existing object in the store with an optimistic mutation result. However, many mutations don't just update an existing object in the store, but they insert a new one.\n\nIn that case we need to specify how to integrate the new data into existing queries, and thus our UI. You can read in detail about how to do that in the article about [interacting with cached data](../caching/cache-interaction/)--in particular, we can use the `update` function to insert a result into an existing query's result set. `update` works exactly the same way for optimistic results and the real results returned from the server.\n\nHere is a concrete example from GitHunt, which inserts a comment into an existing list of comments.\n\n```jsx\nconst SUBMIT_COMMENT_MUTATION = gql`\n  mutation SubmitComment($repoFullName: String!, $commentContent: String!) {\n    submitComment(\n      repoFullName: $repoFullName\n      commentContent: $commentContent\n    ) {\n      postedBy {\n        login\n        html_url\n      }\n      createdAt\n      content\n    }\n  }\n`;\n\nfunction CommentsPageWithMutations({ currentUser }) {\n  const [mutate] = useMutation(SUBMIT_COMMENT_MUTATION);\n  return (\n    <CommentsPage\n      submit={(repoFullName, commentContent) =>\n        mutate({\n          variables: { repoFullName, commentContent },\n          optimisticResponse: {\n            __typename: \"Mutation\",\n            submitComment: {\n              __typename: \"Comment\",\n              postedBy: currentUser,\n              createdAt: new Date(),\n              content: commentContent\n            }\n          },\n          update: (proxy, { data: { submitComment } }) => {\n            // Read the data from our cache for this query.\n            const data = proxy.readQuery({ query: CommentAppQuery });\n            // Write our data back to the cache with the new comment in it\n            proxy.writeQuery({ query: CommentAppQuery, data: {\n              ...data,\n              comments: [...data.comments, submitComment]\n            }});\n          }\n        })\n      }\n    />\n  );\n}\n```\n"}},"__N_SSG":true}
