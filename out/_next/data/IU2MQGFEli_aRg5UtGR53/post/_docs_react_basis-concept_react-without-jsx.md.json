Using React without JSX is especially convenient when you don't want to set up compilation in your build environment.\n\nEach JSX element is just syntactic sugar for calling `React.createElement(component, props, ...children)`. So, anything you can do with JSX can also be done with just plain JavaScript.\n\nFor example, this code written with JSX:\n\n```js\nclass Hello extends React.Component {\n  render() {\n    return <div>Hello {this.props.toWhat}</div>;\n  }\n}\n\nReactDOM.render(\n  <Hello toWhat=\"World\" />,\n  document.getElementById('root')\n);\n```\n\ncan be compiled to this code that does not use JSX:\n\n```js\nclass Hello extends React.Component {\n  render() {\n    return React.createElement('div', null, `Hello ${this.props.toWhat}`);\n  }\n}\n\nReactDOM.render(\n  React.createElement(Hello, {toWhat: 'World'}, null),\n  document.getElementById('root')\n);\n```\n\nIf you're curious to see more examples of how JSX is converted to JavaScript, you can try out [the online Babel compiler](babel://jsx-simple-example).\n\nThe component can either be provided as a string, as a subclass of `React.Component`, or a plain function.\n\nIf you get tired of typing `React.createElement` so much, one common pattern is to assign a shorthand:\n\n```js\nconst e = React.createElement;\n\nReactDOM.render(\n  e('div', null, 'Hello World'),\n  document.getElementById('root')\n);\n```\n\nIf you use this shorthand form for `React.createElement`, it can be almost as convenient to use React without JSX.\n\nAlternatively, you can refer to community projects such as [`react-hyperscript`](https://github.com/mlmorg/react-hyperscript) and [`hyperscript-helpers`](https://github.com/ohanhi/hyperscript-helpers) which offer a terser syntax.\n\n"}},"__N_SSG":true}
