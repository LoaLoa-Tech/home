If you need both, then you want to configure a _two-sided_ relationship.\n\nLet's assume that each post in our blog has a single author and look at how we would use the `ref` option to configure both a one-sided and two-sided relationship.\n\n### One-sided\n\nIf we want to know who the author of a post is, but we're not interested in querying for all the posts written by a given user we can set up a one-sided relationship as follow:\n\n```javascript\nkeystone.createList('User', { fields: { name: { type: Text } } });\n\nkeystone.createList('Post', {\n  fields: {\n    title: { type: Text },\n    content: { type: Text },\n    author: { type: Relationship, ref: 'User', many: false },\n  },\n});\n```\n\nIn the `author` field we have specified `ref: 'User'` to indicate that this field relates to an item in the `User` list.\nWe can now write the following query to find the author for each post:\n\n```graphql\nQuery {\n  allPosts {\n    title\n    content\n    author {\n      name\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Two-sided\n\nIf we also want to access all the posts written by a user then we need to use a two-sided relationship.\n\n```javascript\nkeystone.createList('User', {\n  fields: {\n    name: { type: Text },\n    posts: { type: Relationship, ref: 'Post.author', many: true },\n  },\n});\n\nkeystone.createList('Post', {\n  fields: {\n    title: { type: Text },\n    content: { type: Text },\n    author: { type: Relationship, ref: 'User.posts', many: false },\n  },\n});\n```\n\nIn this case we have a `Relationship` field on both lists, and they both have a `ref` config in the form `<listName>.<fieldName>`.\nThese `Relationship` fields represent the two sides of the relationship, and we can now use the following graphQL query as well:\n\n```graphql\nQuery {\n  allUsers {\n    name\n    posts {\n      title\n      content\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Cardinality\n\nThe second question we need to ask is what the _cardinality_ of our relationship should be.\nThe _cardinality_ of a relationship is the number items which can exist on either side of the relationship.\nIn our blog do we want each post to have exactly one author, or can it have multiple authors?\nAre users allowed to write more than one post or do we want to restrict them to exactly one post each for some reason?\nThe answers to these questions will give us the cardinality of our relationship.\n\nThere are three types of cardinality, `one-to-many`, `many-to-many`, and `one-to-one`, and they can be configured using the `many` config option.\n\n### One-to-many\n\nIf we want a blog where each post can have **one** author, and each user can be the author of **many** posts, then we have a `one-to-many` relationship.\nWe can configure a one-sided version of this:\n\n```javascript\nkeystone.createList('User', { fields: { name: { type: Text } } });\n\nkeystone.createList('Post', {\n  fields: {\n    title: { type: Text },\n    content: { type: Text },\n    author: { type: Relationship, ref: 'User', many: false },\n  },\n});\n```\n\nor a two-sided version:\n\n```javascript\nkeystone.createList('User', {\n  fields: {\n    name: { type: Text },\n    posts: { type: Relationship, ref: 'Post.author', many: true },\n  },\n});\n\nkeystone.createList('Post', {\n  fields: {\n    title: { type: Text },\n    content: { type: Text },\n    author: { type: Relationship, ref: 'User.posts', many: false },\n  },\n});\n```\n\nNote that we have used `many: false` in the `author` field and `many: true` in the `posts` field.\n\n### Many-to-many\n\nIf we want a blog where each post can have **many** authors, and each user can be the author of **many** posts, then we have a `many-to-many` relationship.\nWe can configure a one-sided version of this:\n\n```javascript\nkeystone.createList('User', { fields: { name: { type: Text } } });\n\nkeystone.createList('Post', {\n  fields: {\n    title: { type: Text },\n    content: { type: Text },\n    authors: { type: Relationship, ref: 'User', many: true },\n  },\n});\n```\n\nor a two-sided version:\n\n```javascript\nkeystone.createList('User', {\n  fields: {\n    name: { type: Text },\n    posts: { type: Relationship, ref: 'Post.authors', many: true },\n  },\n});\n\nkeystone.createList('Post', {\n  fields: {\n    title: { type: Text },\n    content: { type: Text },\n    authors: { type: Relationship, ref: 'User.posts', many: true },\n  },\n});\n```\n\nNote that we have used `many: true` in both the `authors` and `posts` fields.\n\n### One-to-one\n\nIf we want a blog where each post has exactly **one** author, and each user is restricted to writing exactly **one** post, then we have a `one-to-one` relationship.\nIn this case we can only specify this with a two-sided relationship:\n\n```javascript\nkeystone.createList('User', {\n  fields: {\n    name: { type: Text },\n    post: { type: Relationship, ref: 'Post.author', many: false },\n  },\n});\n\nkeystone.createList('Post', {\n  fields: {\n    title: { type: Text },\n    content: { type: Text },\n    author: { type: Relationship, ref: 'User.post', many: false },\n  },\n});\n```\n\nNote that we have used `many: false` in both the `authors` and `posts` fields.\n\n## Summary\n\nWhen configuring a relationship in Keystone there are two key questions you need to answer:\n\n- Do I want a one-sided or two-sided relationship?\n- What is the cardinality of my relationship?\n\nOnce you know the answers to these questions you can configure your relationship using the `ref` and `many` options.\n"}},"__N_SSG":true}
