We recommend using hooks for all new Apollo code going forward.\n\n## Core packages\n\nReact hooks functionality is included in the Apollo Client bundle, whereas the older HOC / render prop component approaches are not. The React team has made it clear that hooks are the future, so we've decided to keep the older approaches available through separate packages.\n\n- [`@apollo/client`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@apollo/client) - Apollo Client core with React hooks integration\n- [`@apollo/react-components`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@apollo/react-components) - React Apollo render prop components\n- [`@apollo/react-hoc`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@apollo/react-hoc) - React Apollo HOC (`grapqhl`) API\n\n### Installation/upgrade scenarios\n\n**I just want to use Apollo hooks:**\n\n```\nnpm install @apollo/client\n```\n\n(remove the `react-apollo` and `@apollo/react-hooks` packages if they were previously installed)\n\n**I just want to use Apollo render prop components:**\n\n```\nnpm install @apollo/client @apollo/react-components\n```\n\n(remove the `react-apollo` package if it was previously installed)\n\n**I just want to use Apollo HOCs:**\n\n```\nnpm install @apollo/client @apollo/react-hoc\n```\n\n(remove the `react-apollo` package if it was previously installed)\n\n**I want to use all 3 React paradigms in my application:**\n\n```\nnpm install @apollo/client @apollo/react-components @apollo/react-hoc\n```\n\n(remove the `react-apollo` and `@apollo/react-hooks` packages if they were previously installed)\n\n## Server-side rendering\n\nThe `getDataFromTree`, `getMarkupFromTree`, and `renderToStringWithData` React SSR functions are bundled with Apollo Client 3. If you want to use these functions, you'll need to import them from `@apollo/client/react/ssr`:\n\n```\nimport { getDataFromTree } from \"@apollo/client/react/ssr\";\n```\n\n## Testing\n\nReact testing utilities are now available through the Apollo Client project, but they aren't included in the default bundle. To access the React testing utilities, you can use the `@apollo/client/testing` bundle like:\n\n```\nimport { MockedProvider } from '@apollo/client/testing';\n```\n"}},"__N_SSG":true}
