Same goes for the [`public` directory](/docs/basic-features/static-file-serving.md)\n\n## Related\n\nFor more information on what to do next, we recommend the following sections:\n\n<div class=\"card\">\n  <a href=\"/docs/basic-features/pages.md\">\n    <b>Pages:</b>\n    <small>Learn more about what pages are in Next.js</small>\n  </a>\n</div>\n"}},"__N_SSG":true}
