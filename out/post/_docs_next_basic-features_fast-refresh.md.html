<p>description:
Next.js' Fast Refresh is a new hot reloading experience that gives you
instantaneous feedback on edits made to your React components.</p>
<hr>
<h1>Fast Refresh</h1>
<p><details open>
<summary><b>Examples</b></summary></p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/fast-refresh-demo">Fast Refresh Demo</a></li>
  </ul>
</details>
<p>Fast Refresh is a Next.js feature that gives you instantaneous feedback on
edits made to your React components. Fast Refresh is enabled by default in all
Next.js applications on <strong>9.4 or newer</strong>. With Next.js Fast Refresh enabled,
most edits should be visible within a second, <strong>without losing component
state</strong>.</p>
<h2>How It Works</h2>
<ul>
<li>If you edit a file that <strong>only exports React component(s)</strong>, Fast Refresh will
update the code only for that file, and re-render your component. You can edit
anything in that file, including styles, rendering logic, event handlers, or
effects.</li>
<li>If you edit a file with exports that <em>aren't</em> React components, Fast Refresh
will re-run both that file, and the other files importing it. So if both
<code>Button.js</code> and <code>Modal.js</code> import <code>theme.js</code>, editing <code>theme.js</code> will update
both components.</li>
<li>Finally, if you <strong>edit a file</strong> that's <strong>imported by files outside of the
React tree</strong>, Fast Refresh <strong>will fall back to doing a full reload</strong>. You
might have a file which renders a React component but also exports a value
that is imported by a <strong>non-React component</strong>. For example, maybe your
component also exports a constant, and a non-React utility file imports it. In
that case, consider migrating the constant to a separate file and importing it
into both files. This will re-enable Fast Refresh to work. Other cases can
usually be solved in a similar way.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Error Resilience</h2>
<h3>Syntax Errors</h3>
<p>If you make a syntax error during development, you can fix it and save the file
again. The error will disappear automatically, so you won't need to reload the
app. <strong>You will not lose component state</strong>.</p>
<h3>Runtime Errors</h3>
<p>If you make a mistake that leads to a runtime error inside your component,
you'll be greeted with a contextual overlay. Fixing the error will automatically
dismiss the overlay, without reloading the app.</p>
<p>Component state will be retained if the error did not occur during rendering. If
the error did occur during rendering, React will remount your application using
the updated code.</p>
<p>If you have <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/error-boundaries.html">error boundaries</a>
in your app (which is a good idea for graceful failures in production), they
will retry rendering on the next edit after a rendering error. This means having
an error boundary can prevent you from always getting reset to the root app
state. However, keep in mind that error boundaries shouldn't be <em>too</em> granular.
They are used by React in production, and should always be designed
intentionally.</p>
<h2>Limitations</h2>
<p>Fast Refresh tries to preserve local React state in the component you're
editing, but only if it's safe to do so. Here's a few reasons why you might see
local state being reset on every edit to a file:</p>
<ul>
<li>Local state is not preserved for class components (only function components
and Hooks preserve state).</li>
<li>The file you're editing might have <em>other</em> exports in addition to a React
component.</li>
<li>Sometimes, a file would export the result of calling higher-order component
like <code>HOC(WrappedComponent)</code>. If the returned component is a
class, state will be reset.</li>
<li>Anonymous arrow functions like <code>export default () =&gt; &lt;div /&gt;;</code> cause Fast Refresh to not preserve local component state. For large codebases you can use our <a href="/docs/advanced-features/codemods.md#name-default-component"><code>name-default-component</code> codemod</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>As more of your codebase moves to function components and Hooks, you can expect
state to be preserved in more cases.</p>
<h2>Tips</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fast Refresh preserves React local state in function components (and Hooks) by
default.</li>
<li>Sometimes you might want to <em>force</em> the state to be reset, and a component to
be remounted. For example, this can be handy if you're tweaking an animation
that only happens on mount. To do this, you can add <code>// @refresh reset</code>
anywhere in the file you're editing. This directive is local to the file, and
instructs Fast Refresh to remount components defined in that file on every
edit.</li>
<li>You can put <code>console.log</code> or <code>debugger;</code> into the components you edit during
development.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Fast Refresh and Hooks</h2>
<p>When possible, Fast Refresh attempts to preserve the state of your component
between edits. In particular, <code>useState</code> and <code>useRef</code> preserve their previous
values as long as you don't change their arguments or the order of the Hook
calls.</p>
<p>Hooks with dependencies—such as <code>useEffect</code>, <code>useMemo</code>, and <code>useCallback</code>—will
<em>always</em> update during Fast Refresh. Their list of dependencies will be ignored
while Fast Refresh is happening.</p>
<p>For example, when you edit <code>useMemo(() =&gt; x * 2, [x])</code> to
<code>useMemo(() =&gt; x * 10, [x])</code>, it will re-run even though <code>x</code> (the dependency)
has not changed. If React didn't do that, your edit wouldn't reflect on the
screen!</p>
<p>Sometimes, this can lead to unexpected results. For example, even a <code>useEffect</code>
with an empty array of dependencies would still re-run once during Fast Refresh.</p>
<p>However, writing code resilient to occasional re-running of <code>useEffect</code> is a good practice even
without Fast Refresh. It will make it easier for you to introduce new dependencies to it later on
and it's enforced by <a href="/docs/api-reference/next.config.js/react-strict-mode.md">React Strict Mode</a>,
which we highly recommend enabling.</p>
