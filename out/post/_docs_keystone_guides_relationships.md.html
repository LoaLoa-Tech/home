title: Configuring relationships
[meta]-->
<h1>Configuring relationships</h1>
<p>Keystone allows you to model your data by declaring <a href="/docs/discussions/relationships.md">relationships</a> between lists.
There are a number of different ways you can configure relationships, depending on how you want to model your data and how you need to access it from the graphQL API.
This guide will step you through the decision making process to help you get all your configurations just right.</p>
<p>Throughout this guide we will use the example of a blog application which has <code>Users</code> and <code>Posts</code>.</p>
<h2>One-sided vs two-sided</h2>
<p>A relationship in Keystone exists <em>between</em> two lists.
In our blog, the concept of <em>authorship</em> (who wrote a post) can be represented as a relationship between the <code>User</code> and the <code>Post</code> lists.</p>
<p>The first question you need to consider is which list do you want to be able to access the relationship from in your graphQL API?
In our blog we might want to be able to ask about a <code>user's posts</code>, a <code>post's author</code>, or possibly both.
If you only need to access one side of the relationship then you want to configure a <em>one-sided</em> relationship. If you need both, then you want to configure a <em>two-sided</em> relationship.</p>
<p>Let's assume that each post in our blog has a single author and look at how we would use the <code>ref</code> option to configure both a one-sided and two-sided relationship.</p>
<h3>One-sided</h3>
<p>If we want to know who the author of a post is, but we're not interested in querying for all the posts written by a given user we can set up a one-sided relationship as follow:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">keystone.createList('User', { fields: { name: { type: Text } } });

keystone.createList('Post', {
  fields: {
    title: { type: Text },
    content: { type: Text },
    author: { type: Relationship, ref: 'User', many: false },
  },
});
</code></pre>
<p>In the <code>author</code> field we have specified <code>ref: 'User'</code> to indicate that this field relates to an item in the <code>User</code> list.
We can now write the following query to find the author for each post:</p>
<pre><code class="language-graphql">Query {
  allPosts {
    title
    content
    author {
      name
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>
<h3>Two-sided</h3>
<p>If we also want to access all the posts written by a user then we need to use a two-sided relationship.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">keystone.createList('User', {
  fields: {
    name: { type: Text },
    posts: { type: Relationship, ref: 'Post.author', many: true },
  },
});

keystone.createList('Post', {
  fields: {
    title: { type: Text },
    content: { type: Text },
    author: { type: Relationship, ref: 'User.posts', many: false },
  },
});
</code></pre>
<p>In this case we have a <code>Relationship</code> field on both lists, and they both have a <code>ref</code> config in the form <code>&lt;listName&gt;.&lt;fieldName&gt;</code>.
These <code>Relationship</code> fields represent the two sides of the relationship, and we can now use the following graphQL query as well:</p>
<pre><code class="language-graphql">Query {
  allUsers {
    name
    posts {
      title
      content
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>
<h2>Cardinality</h2>
<p>The second question we need to ask is what the <em>cardinality</em> of our relationship should be.
The <em>cardinality</em> of a relationship is the number items which can exist on either side of the relationship.
In our blog do we want each post to have exactly one author, or can it have multiple authors?
Are users allowed to write more than one post or do we want to restrict them to exactly one post each for some reason?
The answers to these questions will give us the cardinality of our relationship.</p>
<p>There are three types of cardinality, <code>one-to-many</code>, <code>many-to-many</code>, and <code>one-to-one</code>, and they can be configured using the <code>many</code> config option.</p>
<h3>One-to-many</h3>
<p>If we want a blog where each post can have <strong>one</strong> author, and each user can be the author of <strong>many</strong> posts, then we have a <code>one-to-many</code> relationship.
We can configure a one-sided version of this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">keystone.createList('User', { fields: { name: { type: Text } } });

keystone.createList('Post', {
  fields: {
    title: { type: Text },
    content: { type: Text },
    author: { type: Relationship, ref: 'User', many: false },
  },
});
</code></pre>
<p>or a two-sided version:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">keystone.createList('User', {
  fields: {
    name: { type: Text },
    posts: { type: Relationship, ref: 'Post.author', many: true },
  },
});

keystone.createList('Post', {
  fields: {
    title: { type: Text },
    content: { type: Text },
    author: { type: Relationship, ref: 'User.posts', many: false },
  },
});
</code></pre>
<p>Note that we have used <code>many: false</code> in the <code>author</code> field and <code>many: true</code> in the <code>posts</code> field.</p>
<h3>Many-to-many</h3>
<p>If we want a blog where each post can have <strong>many</strong> authors, and each user can be the author of <strong>many</strong> posts, then we have a <code>many-to-many</code> relationship.
We can configure a one-sided version of this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">keystone.createList('User', { fields: { name: { type: Text } } });

keystone.createList('Post', {
  fields: {
    title: { type: Text },
    content: { type: Text },
    authors: { type: Relationship, ref: 'User', many: true },
  },
});
</code></pre>
<p>or a two-sided version:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">keystone.createList('User', {
  fields: {
    name: { type: Text },
    posts: { type: Relationship, ref: 'Post.authors', many: true },
  },
});

keystone.createList('Post', {
  fields: {
    title: { type: Text },
    content: { type: Text },
    authors: { type: Relationship, ref: 'User.posts', many: true },
  },
});
</code></pre>
<p>Note that we have used <code>many: true</code> in both the <code>authors</code> and <code>posts</code> fields.</p>
<h3>One-to-one</h3>
<p>If we want a blog where each post has exactly <strong>one</strong> author, and each user is restricted to writing exactly <strong>one</strong> post, then we have a <code>one-to-one</code> relationship.
In this case we can only specify this with a two-sided relationship:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">keystone.createList('User', {
  fields: {
    name: { type: Text },
    post: { type: Relationship, ref: 'Post.author', many: false },
  },
});

keystone.createList('Post', {
  fields: {
    title: { type: Text },
    content: { type: Text },
    author: { type: Relationship, ref: 'User.post', many: false },
  },
});
</code></pre>
<p>Note that we have used <code>many: false</code> in both the <code>authors</code> and <code>posts</code> fields.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>When configuring a relationship in Keystone there are two key questions you need to answer:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do I want a one-sided or two-sided relationship?</li>
<li>What is the cardinality of my relationship?</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you know the answers to these questions you can configure your relationship using the <code>ref</code> and <code>many</code> options.</p>

an item in the `User` list.\nWe can now write the following query to find the author for each post:\n\n```graphql\nQuery {\n  allPosts {\n    title\n    content\n    author {\n      name\n    }\n

Text },\n    author: { type: Relationship, ref: 'User.posts', many: false },\n  },\n});\n```\n\nIn this case we have a `Relationship` field on both lists, and they both have a `ref` config in the form `\u003clistName\u003e.\u003cfieldName\u003e`.\nThese `Relationship` fields represent the two sides of the relationship, and we can now use the following graphQL query as well:\n\n```graphql\nQuery {\n  allUsers {\n    name\n    posts {\n      title\n      content\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Cardinality\n\nThe second question we need to ask is what the _cardinality_ of our relationship should be.\nThe

author: { type: Relationship, ref: 'User', many: false },\n  },\n});\n```\n\nor a two-sided version:\n\n```javascript\nkeystone.createList('User', {\n  fields: {\n    name: { type: Text },\n    posts: { type: Relationship, ref: 'Post.author', many: true },\n  },\n});\n\nkeystone.createList('Post', {\n  fields: {\n    title: { type: Text },\n    content: { type: Text },\n    author: { type: Relationship, ref: 'User.posts', many: false },\n  },\n});\n```\n\nNote that we have used `many: false` in the `author` field and `many: true` in the `posts` field.\n\n### Many-to-many\n\nIf we want a

Relationship, ref: 'User.posts', many: true },\n  },\n});\n```\n\nNote that we have used `many: true` in both the `authors` and `posts` fields.\n\n### One-to-one\n\nIf we want a blog where each post has exactly **one** author, and each user is restricted to writing exactly **one** post, then we have a `one-to-one` relationship.\nIn this case we can only specify this with a two-sided
