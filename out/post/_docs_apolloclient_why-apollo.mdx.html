<p>title: Why Apollo Client?
description: Why choose Apollo Client to manage your data?</p>
<hr>
<p>Data management shouldn't have to be so difficult! If you're wondering how to simplify managing remote and local data in your React application, then you've come to the right place. Throughout this documentation, you'll learn how Apollo's intelligent caching and declarative approach to data fetching can help you iterate faster while writing less code. Let's jump right in! 🚀</p>
<h2>Declarative data fetching</h2>
<p>With Apollo's declarative approach to data fetching, all of the logic for retrieving your data, tracking loading and error states, and updating your UI is encapsulated by the <code>useQuery</code> Hook. This encapsulation makes integrating query results into your presentational components a breeze! Let's see what this looks like in practice with Apollo Client and React:</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">function Feed() {
  const { loading, error, data } = useQuery(GET_DOGS);
  if (error) return &lt;Error /&gt;;
  if (loading || !data) return &lt;Fetching /&gt;;

  return &lt;DogList dogs={data.dogs} /&gt;;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Here we're using the <code>useQuery</code> Hook to fetch some dogs from our GraphQL server and display them in a list. <code>useQuery</code> leverages React's <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html">Hooks API</a> to bind a query to our component and render it based on the results of our query. Once our data comes back, our <code>&lt;DogList /&gt;</code> component will update reactively with the data it needs.</p>
<p>Apollo Client takes care of the request cycle from start to finish, including tracking loading and error states for you. There's no middleware to set up or boilerplate to write before making your first request, nor do you need to worry about transforming and caching the response. All you have to do is describe the data your component needs and let Apollo Client do the heavy lifting. 💪</p>
<p>You'll find that when you switch to Apollo Client, you'll be able to delete a lot of unnecessary code related to data management. The exact amount will vary depending on your application, but some teams have reported up to thousands of lines. While you'll find yourself writing less code with Apollo, that doesn't mean you have to compromise on features! Advanced features like optimistic UI, refetching, and pagination are all easily accessible through <code>useQuery</code> options.</p>
<h2>Zero-config caching</h2>
<p>One of the key features that sets Apollo Client apart from other data management solutions is its normalized cache. Apollo Client includes an intelligent cache out of the box, that requires very little configuration to get started with.</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">import { ApolloClient, InMemoryCache } from '@apollo/client';

const client = new ApolloClient({
  cache: new InMemoryCache()
});
</code></pre>
<p>Caching a graph is no easy task, but we've spent two years focused on solving it. Since you can have multiple paths leading to the same data, normalization is essential for keeping your data consistent across multiple components. Let's look at some practical examples:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">const GET_ALL_DOGS = gql`
  query GetAllDogs {
    dogs {
      id
      breed
      displayImage
    }
  }
`;

const UPDATE_DISPLAY_IMAGE = gql`
  mutation UpdateDisplayImage($id: String!, $displayImage: String!) {
    updateDisplayImage(id: $id, displayImage: $displayImage) {
      id
      displayImage
    }
  }
`;
</code></pre>
<p>The query, <code>GET_ALL_DOGS</code>, fetches a list of dogs and their <code>displayImage</code>. The mutation, <code>UPDATE_DISPLAY_IMAGE</code>, updates a single dog's <code>displayImage</code>. If we update the <code>displayImage</code> on a specific dog, we also need that item on the list of all dogs to reflect the new data. Apollo Client splits out each object in a GraphQL result with a <code>__typename</code> and an <code>id</code> property into its own entry in the Apollo cache. This guarantees that returning a value from a mutation with an id will automatically update any queries that fetch the object with the same id. It also ensures that two queries which return the same data will always be in sync.</p>
<p>Features that are normally complicated to execute are trivial to build with the Apollo cache. Let's go back to our <code>GET_ALL_DOGS</code> query from the previous example that displays a list of dogs. What if we want to transition to a detail page for a specific dog? Since we've already fetched information on each dog, we don't want to refetch the same information from our server. Thanks to Apollo Client's cache policies API, we can connect the dots between two queries so we don't have to fetch information that we know is already available.</p>
<p>Here's what our query for one dog looks like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">const GET_DOG = gql`
  query GetDog {
    dog(id: &quot;abc&quot;) {
      id
      breed
      displayImage
    }
  }
`;
</code></pre>
<p>Here we define a custom <code>FieldPolicy</code> that returns a reference to the cached <code>Dog</code> data, which our query can then use to retrieve that data.</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">import { ApolloClient, InMemoryCache } from '@apollo/client';

const cache = new InMemoryCache({
  typePolicies: {
    Query: {
      fields: {
        dog(_, { args, toReference }) {
          return toReference({
            __typename: 'Dog',
            id: args.id,
          });
        }
      }
    }
  }
});

const client = new ApolloClient({ cache });
</code></pre>
<h2>Combine local &amp; remote data</h2>
<p>Thousands of developers have told us that Apollo Client excels at managing remote data, which equates to roughly 80% of their data needs. But what about local data (like global flags and device API results) that make up the other 20% of the pie? Apollo Client includes <a href="local-state/local-state-management/">local state management</a> features out of the box, that allow you to use your Apollo cache as the single source of truth for data in your application.</p>
<p>Managing all your data with Apollo Client allows you to take advantage of GraphQL as a unified interface to all of your data. This enables you to inspect both your local and remote schemas in Apollo DevTools through GraphiQL.</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">const GET_DOG = gql`
  query GetDogByBreed($breed: String!) {
    dog(breed: $breed) {
      images {
        url
        id
        isLiked @client
      }
    }
  }
`;
</code></pre>
<p>By leveraging Apollo Client's local state functionality, you can add client-side only fields to your remote data seamlessly and query them from your components. In this example, we're querying the client-only field <code>isLiked</code> alongside our server data. Your components are made up of local and remote data, now your queries can be too!</p>
<h2>Vibrant ecosystem</h2>
<p>Apollo Client is easy to get started with, but extensible for when you need to build out more advanced features. If you need custom functionality that isn't covered with <code>@apollo/client</code>, such as app-specific middleware or cache persistence, you can leverage the Apollo Link architecture to plug-in new network stack functionality.</p>
<p>This flexibility makes it simple to create your dream client by building extensions on top of Apollo. We're always really impressed by what our contributors have built on top of Apollo - check out some of their packages:</p>
