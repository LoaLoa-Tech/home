</ul>
<hr>
<p>This section will give you an overview of the React codebase organization, its conventions, and the implementation.</p>
<p>If you want to <a href="/docs/how-to-contribute.html">contribute to React</a> we hope that this guide will help you feel more comfortable making changes.</p>
<p>We don't necessarily recommend any of these conventions in React apps. Many of them exist for historical reasons and might change with time.</p>
<h3>Top-Level Folders {#top-level-folders}</h3>
<p>After cloning the <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react">React repository</a>, you will see a few top-level folders in it:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/master/packages"><code>packages</code></a> contains metadata (such as <code>package.json</code>) and the source code (<code>src</code> subdirectory) for all packages in the React repository. <strong>If your change is related to the code, the <code>src</code> subdirectory of each package is where you'll spend most of your time.</strong></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/master/fixtures"><code>fixtures</code></a> contains a few small React test applications for contributors.</li>
<li><code>build</code> is the build output of React. It is not in the repository but it will appear in your React clone after you <a href="/docs/how-to-contribute.html#development-workflow">build it</a> for the first time.</li>
</ul>
<p>The documentation is hosted <a href="https://github.com/reactjs/reactjs.org">in a separate repository from React</a>.</p>
<p>There are a few other top-level folders but they are mostly used for the tooling and you likely won't ever encounter them when contributing.</p>
<h3>Colocated Tests {#colocated-tests}</h3>
<p>We don't have a top-level directory for unit tests. Instead, we put them into a directory called <code>__tests__</code> relative to the files that they test.</p>
<p>For example, a test for <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/87724bd87506325fcaf2648c70fc1f43411a87be/src/renderers/dom/client/utils/setInnerHTML.js"><code>setInnerHTML.js</code></a> is located in <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/87724bd87506325fcaf2648c70fc1f43411a87be/src/renderers/dom/client/utils/__tests__/setInnerHTML-test.js"><code>__tests__/setInnerHTML-test.js</code></a> right next to it.</p>
<h3>Warnings and Invariants {#warnings-and-invariants}</h3>
<p>The React codebase uses <code>console.error</code> to display warnings:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">if (__DEV__) {
  console.error('Something is wrong.');
}
</code></pre>
<p>Warnings are only enabled in development. In production, they are completely stripped out. If you need to forbid some code path from executing, use <code>invariant</code> module instead:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">var invariant = require('invariant');

invariant(
  2 + 2 === 4,
  'You shall not pass!'
);
</code></pre>
<p><strong>The invariant is thrown when the <code>invariant</code> condition is <code>false</code>.</strong></p>
<p>&quot;Invariant&quot; is just a way of saying &quot;this condition always holds true&quot;. You can think about it as making an assertion.</p>
<p>It is important to keep development and production behavior similar, so <code>invariant</code> throws both in development and in production. The error messages are automatically replaced with error codes in production to avoid negatively affecting the byte size.</p>
<h3>Development and Production {#development-and-production}</h3>
<p>You can use <code>__DEV__</code> pseudo-global variable in the codebase to guard development-only blocks of code.</p>
<p>It is inlined during the compile step, and turns into <code>process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production'</code> checks in the CommonJS builds.</p>
<p>For standalone builds, it becomes <code>true</code> in the unminified build, and gets completely stripped out with the <code>if</code> blocks it guards in the minified build.</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">if (__DEV__) {
  // This code will only run in development.
}
</code></pre>
<h3>Flow {#flow}</h3>
<p>We recently started introducing <a href="https://flow.org/">Flow</a> checks to the codebase. Files marked with the <code>@flow</code> annotation in the license header comment are being typechecked.</p>
<p>We accept pull requests <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/7600/files">adding Flow annotations to existing code</a>. Flow annotations look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">ReactRef.detachRefs = function(
  instance: ReactInstance,
  element: ReactElement | string | number | null | false,
): void {
  // ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>When possible, new code should use Flow annotations.
You can run <code>yarn flow</code> locally to check your code with Flow.</p>
<h3>Multiple Packages {#multiple-packages}</h3>
<p>React is a <a href="https://danluu.com/monorepo/">monorepo</a>. Its repository contains multiple separate packages so that their changes can be coordinated together, and issues live in one place.</p>
<h3>React Core {#react-core}</h3>
<p>The &quot;core&quot; of React includes all the <a href="/docs/top-level-api.html#react">top-level <code>React</code> APIs</a>, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>React.createElement()</code></li>
<li><code>React.Component</code></li>
<li><code>React.Children</code></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>React core only includes the APIs necessary to define components.</strong> It does not include the <a href="/docs/reconciliation.html">reconciliation</a> algorithm or any platform-specific code. It is used both by React DOM and React Native components.</p>
<p>The code for React core is located in <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/master/packages/react"><code>packages/react</code></a> in the source tree. It is available on npm as the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/react"><code>react</code></a> package. The corresponding standalone browser build is called <code>react.js</code>, and it exports a global called <code>React</code>.</p>
<h3>Renderers {#renderers}</h3>
<p>React was originally created for the DOM but it was later adapted to also support native platforms with <a href="https://reactnative.dev/">React Native</a>. This introduced the concept of &quot;renderers&quot; to React internals.</p>
<p><strong>Renderers manage how a React tree turns into the underlying platform calls.</strong></p>
<p>Renderers are also located in <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/master/packages/"><code>packages/</code></a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/master/packages/react-dom">React DOM Renderer</a> renders React components to the DOM. It implements <a href="/docs/react-dom.html">top-level <code>ReactDOM</code> APIs</a> and is available as <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-dom"><code>react-dom</code></a> npm package. It can also be used as standalone browser bundle called <code>react-dom.js</code> that exports a <code>ReactDOM</code> global.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/master/packages/react-native-renderer">React Native Renderer</a> renders React components to native views. It is used internally by React Native.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/master/packages/react-test-renderer">React Test Renderer</a> renders React components to JSON trees. It is used by the <a href="https://facebook.github.io/jest/blog/2016/07/27/jest-14.html">Snapshot Testing</a> feature of <a href="https://facebook.github.io/jest">Jest</a> and is available as <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-test-renderer">react-test-renderer</a> npm package.</li>
</ul>
<p>The only other officially supported renderer is <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/master/packages/react-art"><code>react-art</code></a>. It used to be in a separate <a href="https://github.com/reactjs/react-art">GitHub repository</a> but we moved it into the main source tree for now.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>
<p>Technically the <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/master/packages/react-native-renderer"><code>react-native-renderer</code></a> is a very thin layer that teaches React to interact with React Native implementation. The real platform-specific code managing the native views lives in the <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react-native">React Native repository</a> together with its components.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Reconcilers {#reconcilers}</h3>
<p>Even vastly different renderers like React DOM and React Native need to share a lot of logic. In particular, the <a href="/docs/reconciliation.html">reconciliation</a> algorithm should be as similar as possible so that declarative rendering, custom components, state, lifecycle methods, and refs work consistently across platforms.</p>
<p>To solve this, different renderers share some code between them. We call this part of React a &quot;reconciler&quot;. When an update such as <code>setState()</code> is scheduled, the reconciler calls <code>render()</code> on components in the tree and mounts, updates, or unmounts them.</p>
<p>Reconcilers are not packaged separately because they currently have no public API. Instead, they are exclusively used by renderers such as React DOM and React Native.</p>
<h3>Stack Reconciler {#stack-reconciler}</h3>
<p>The &quot;stack&quot; reconciler is the implementation powering React 15 and earlier. We have since stopped using it, but it is documented in detail in the <a href="/docs/implementation-notes.html">next section</a>.</p>
<h3>Fiber Reconciler {#fiber-reconciler}</h3>
<p>The &quot;fiber&quot; reconciler is a new effort aiming to resolve the problems inherent in the stack reconciler and fix a few long-standing issues. It has been the default reconciler since React 16.</p>
<p>Its main goals are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ability to split interruptible work in chunks.</li>
<li>Ability to prioritize, rebase and reuse work in progress.</li>
<li>Ability to yield back and forth between parents and children to support layout in React.</li>
<li>Ability to return multiple elements from <code>render()</code>.</li>
<li>Better support for error boundaries.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can read more about React Fiber Architecture <a href="https://github.com/acdlite/react-fiber-architecture">here</a> and <a href="https://blog.ag-grid.com/inside-fiber-an-in-depth-overview-of-the-new-reconciliation-algorithm-in-react">here</a>. While it has shipped with React 16, the async features are not enabled by default yet.</p>
<p>Its source code is located in <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/master/packages/react-reconciler"><code>packages/react-reconciler</code></a>.</p>
<h3>Event System {#event-system}</h3>
<p>React implements a layer over native events to smooth out cross-browser differences. Its source code is located in <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/master/packages/react-dom/src/events"><code>packages/react-dom/src/events</code></a>.</p>
<h3>What Next? {#what-next}</h3>
<p>Read the <a href="/docs/implementation-notes.html">next section</a> to learn about the pre-React 16 implementation of reconciler in more detail. We haven't documented the internals of the new reconciler yet.</p>
